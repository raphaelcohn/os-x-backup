# Lists time machine snapshots to standard out as their dates, sorted from oldest to newest.
# A time machine date is formatted `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS`.
# Optionally takes a deviceVolume.
#
# If mount_point is not a disk returns an error message and exit code 22.
#
# Example 1 (list_all_time_machine_snapshot_dates_sorted):-
# 
# Snapshot dates for all disks:
# 2021-06-03-085732
# 2021-06-03-090320
#
# Example 2 (list_all_time_machine_snapshot_dates_sorted '/'):-
# 
# Snapshot dates for disk /:
# 2021-06-03-085732
# 2021-06-03-090320
